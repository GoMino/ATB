Android ToolBox
=======

## Introduction

This is a framework I ended up with in my everyday development on the Android Plateform, it is mainly a set of utility classes, views, and helpers

* Easy logging (automatically decorated with class name, function name and line number)
* SSDP utils for easy discovery 
* Social Manager for Twitter And Facebook
* BaseAdapter subclasses using generics (all you have to do now is implement getView)
* A lot of helpful custom views
